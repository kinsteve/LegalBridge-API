✅ LSP Onboarding and Management: Legal professionals interested in offering their services can join the platform by completing a rigorous onboarding process, which includes verifying their credentials, such as Bar ID, educational qualifications, legal degrees, domain expertise, and specific experience.

✅ In-Platform Communication: To facilitate effective communication between clients and LSPs, LegalBridge includes a secure and private messaging system.

✅ Transparent Rating System: Clients have the opportunity to rate and review the LSPs they've interacted with, promoting transparency and ensuring quality service.
